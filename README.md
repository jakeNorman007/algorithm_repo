# algorithm_repo

## Basic algorithms you may find in the wild

In the most basic terms this is a repo that contains a lot of besic algorithms and tests that will help you
write them.

In one directory you will find the algorithms completed as I work through them, and in another directory
you will find a blank file that will allow you to try and write them yourself.

Along side those you will find tests for all the algorithms, so when you write the code for what algo you're
attempting, you will be able to test to see of you did it correctly.
