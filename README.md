# Algorithm workbook

## Basic algorithms you may find in the wild

A repository/workbook made for working on and practicing some very common algorithms you'll find in computer
science. Sorts, searches, stacks and some general problems to solve.

This repository has both a key directory with all problems completed and a directory titled "workbook", in which
the same problems are available, blank so anyone can work through them on their own! With the key repository
you will be able to get hints or work through them in your head to try and see what is going on.

When you are ready to try to work through these problems, there are test cases written for all the problems, so 
as you're working on a problem you can check to see if it passes and that it's done correctly.
